# PROJECT TITLE

Taller Code Challenge

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

Get the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

Given a string str, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:
For "ABDEFGABEF", the longest substring are "BDEFGA" and "DEFGAB", with length 6.

For "BBBB" the longest substring is "B", with length 1.

For "GEEKSFORGEEKS", there are two longest substrings shown in the below diagrams, with length 7 */

## NODE VERSION

Node v21.2.0 was used to complete this challenge.

## SETUP

- Please run "npm install" before testing the application; a javascript testing library called "Jest" was used for this challenge.

## EXECUTING THE APP

- Run the following command to execute the app: node index.js

- Since the sample string "ABDEFGABEF" was hardcoded in the index.js file, running "node index.js" will return the number "6" as a result in the console.

- Feel free to modify the sample string to see different, correct results.

## UNIT TESTING

- A javascript testing library called "Jest" was used for this challenge.

- Tests were written in the "index.test.js" file.

- Run the following command to execute the unit tests: npm run test

- The "Red, green, refactor" approach was used to write the unit tests.
